        <div class="ptag"><p>We all know it’s great to set goals for ourselves. It’s a motivating factor that allows us to focus on the task at hand. But is it a good technique to set short-term goals in the classroom? Some may argue that it allows inattentive kids to focus more easily when they have attainable goals to check off their list. But is that setting the bar too low? Is curiosity and exploration being discouraged by not allowing children to step out of their comfort zones?<br><br>
When I was a child, I was an avid bookworm. I loved reading and had read practically half of my school’s enormous library by third grade. I loved challenging myself with books that seemed they might be difficult for a youngster such as myself. When it was announced that my family would be packing it up and moving to Texas, I was thrilled. A new school, with new people, new classrooms, and new books! Of course, there were some things that met my expectations, and others that didn’t.<br><br>
One of the most disappointing things was the library. My old school had had a gigantic library comparable to a gymnasium. The new school’s library felt like a broom closet in comparison. It was tiny and stuffy and only held a measly couple of bookshelves. Nevertheless, I remained enthusiastic about getting to read new stories. Upon my first library visit, however, I was informed that all of the books were marked with colored stickers that were in correlation with reading level. In order to increase your reading level, you would have to read books and then take Accelerated Reader, or AR, tests on that book. Because I was new to the district and had no AR points under my belt, they allowed me to start at the average reading level of a fourth grader.<br><br>
            <h2><span class="pullquote">"The limitation is seen as a barrier <br>rather than a goal."</span></h2>
            
<br><br><p>Apparently, the average fourth grader could hardly read. I was being forced to read books that were so far below my reading level. I read about one book a day so I could take more AR tests and rack up my points. I was able to easily get my score up enough to be able to read the books labeled with the “challenging” stickers. I was just that ambitious to read. But what about all the other children who aren’t willing to take on the challenge?<br><br>
Many kids don’t enjoy reading. For them, being told they can only read at their reading level means nothing. If they don’t even enjoy reading, what’s their motivation for trying to hone that skill?
The limitation is seen as a barrier rather than a goal. And by setting such limitations, it is as if the education system is discouraging students rather than encouraging them. What ever happened to the mentality that we should push ourselves? Step outside the boundaries and try to do something beyond your skill level! There’s no way to get better unless things get harder.

        <h4>What "No Child Left Behind" 
            Left Behind</h4>
        <p>The metamorphosis of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) from No Child Left Behind (NCLB) into the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) is being hailed as a historic triumph of bipartisan compromise (HTBC). Why, we haven’t seen such lopsided approval votes in Congress since . . . well, since Democrats and Republicans put aside their petty differences and agreed by overwhelming margins to let Bush invade Iraq.<br>
            All right, fine. I’m not suggesting the new education law is analogous to that — or even that it merely trades one Orwellian legislative label for another. ESSA does represent a substantive shift: It returns a fair amount of control...
